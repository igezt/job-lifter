# Job Lifter

Looking to lift your career to a higher level? Look no further!

Job-lifter is a React-native application that allows you to use RapidAPI's JSearch API to easily and quickly look for jobs that suit your needs.

## Set-up

Simply fork and clone the repository on your own device and run

```
  npm install
```

on the root directory of the project.

Then use

```
npm start
```

to start up the app.

A QR code will then be generated in your console which you can scan using the Expo Go app (easily downloaded from App Store or Google Play Store). Then you can freely use the application!

## How to use the application

### Home Screen

Upon scanning using the Expo-Go app, you will be greeted with a front page.

Clicking on any of the job cards will bring you to their job description pages where you can read about their job description, qualifications they are looking for and responsibilities attached to the job.

### Applying for the job

If the job appeals to you, then simply click on "Apply for Job" to automatically re-route to their home-page
